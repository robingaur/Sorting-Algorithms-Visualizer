# Sorting Algorithms Visualizer
In this project, you can visualize the sorting algorithms.
Currently, the following algorithms are supported:
* Bubble Sort
* Insertion Sort
* Selection Sort
* Quick Sort
* Merge Sort
* Merge Sort - O(1) Space
* Heap Sort

## Getting Started
You can easily import this project in any editor (IntelliJ prefer) or you can complie the code and run the [Main.java](https://github.com/robingaur/Sorting-Algorithms-Visualizer/blob/master/src/Main.java) file present in [src](https://github.com/robingaur/Sorting-Algorithms-Visualizer/blob/master/src) folder.

### Prerequisites

* Java 12
* Knowledge Of Data Structure mainly Sorting algorithm.
* Knows how to compile and run the Java Code.

### How to Use
You can Shuffle the data from the menu bar under the menu tab or just press 'S'.
While algortihms is running you can play/pause the algorithm from the menu bar under the menu tab or by pressing space.
You can avoid any animation by selecting Finish Execution in the menu bar under the menu tab or by pressing 'F'.
You can select given algorithm from the menu bar under the algorithms tab.
You can adjust the animation speed by using slider in the menu bar under the Animation Speed.
