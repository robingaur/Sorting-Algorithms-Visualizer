# Sorting Algorithms Visualizer
In this project, you can visualize the sorting algorithms.
Currently, the following algorithms are supported:
* [Bubble Sort](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/bubble-sort)
* [Insertion Sort](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/insertion-sort)
* [Selection Sort](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/selection-sort)
* [Quick Sort](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/quick-sort)
* [Merge Sort](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/merge-sort)
* Merge Sort - O(1) Space
* [Heap Sort](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/heap-sort)

## Getting Started
You can easily import this project in any editor (IntelliJ prefer) or you can complie the code and run the [Main.java](https://github.com/robingaur/Sorting-Algorithms-Visualizer/blob/master/src/Main.java) file present in [src](https://github.com/robingaur/Sorting-Algorithms-Visualizer/blob/master/src) folder.

### Prerequisites

* Java 12
* Knowledge of Data Structure mainly on Sorting algorithm.
* Knows how to compile and run the Java Code.

### How to Use
* You can Shuffle the data from the menu bar under the menu tab or just press 'S'.
* While algorithm is running you can play/pause the algorithm from the menu bar under the menu tab or by pressing space.
* You can avoid any animation by selecting Finish Execution in the menu bar under the menu tab or by pressing 'F'.
* You can select given algorithm from the menu bar under the algorithms tab.
* You can adjust the animation speed by using slider in the menu bar under the Animation Speed.
